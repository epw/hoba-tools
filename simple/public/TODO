(Just immediate things; more details in NOTES)

- Improve UI a lot for logging in new devices. Clear button, etc
- Add password-derived key support:
  - Option to enter a unique ID and password instead of a code from another device
  - Create private key from password, then continue normally.
  - Configuration option to present this first, for people who want a more-familiar login system
